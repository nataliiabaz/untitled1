            - create a constructor that creates a Food object with the name, quantity, and unit price
                -> call calculatePrice() method here

        - method:

            - calculatePrice(): multiple the quantity by unit price and assign the value to the total price

            - toString()
                print all the Food information

    Create a separate class to create and test the Food objects

        try making an array of Food objects
        find all the Food objects that start with 'a' and print the whole information
        find all the Food objects that have a total price over 20 and print the name of the food
